For the signature challenge this week, the bakers were tasked to make 12 decorated chocolate biscuit bars. For the technical challenge, Paul tasked a "controversial" bake that was his dad's favourite- 12 [[fig rolls]] that needed to be identical in shape and size. For the showstopper, the bakers were asked to create a 3D biscuit sculpture.
