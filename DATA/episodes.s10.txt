For the technical challenge set by Prue, the bakers had to bake six identical [[angel cake]] slices, with layers made of genoise sponge sandwiched with Italian meringue buttercream, topped with icing and feathered in 1¾ hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers had to bake a [[birthday cake]] from a childhood dream in 4 hours.

=== Episode 2: Biscuits ===
For the signature challenge this week, the bakers were tasked to make 12 decorated chocolate biscuit bars. For the technical challenge, Paul tasked a "controversial" bake that was his dad's favourite- 12 [[fig rolls]] that needed to be identical in shape and size. For the showstopper, the bakers were asked to create a 3D biscuit sculpture.
